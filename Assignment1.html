      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The Taj Mahal is a 17th-century white marble mausoleum built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal.
        It is one of the most famous monuments in the world and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Taj combines elements of Islamic,
        Persian, Ottoman Turkish and Indian architectural styles.
